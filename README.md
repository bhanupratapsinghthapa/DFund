# DFund - Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

A collaborative project developed by Computer Engineering students at Graphic Era Hill University Bhimtal as part of our Final Year Project (2024-2025). DFund is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that revolutionizes how we support causes and ideas through transparent and secure fundraising.

## Project Overview

As a team of four engineering students, we identified the challenges in traditional crowdfunding platforms such as high fees, lack of transparency, and geographical restrictions. DFund represents our solution to these problems, leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless and efficient fundraising environment.
